### Securing resources
- Identity and Access Management (IAM): is primarily focused on helping you control access to your AWS resources
- KMS: handles access keys
- SSH: secure shell (key-pairs)
- MFA
- federated identities   

### AWS IAM
- Identity and access management
- IAM Policy: A “set of permissions”
- IAM password policy: Require at least one uppercase letter, at least one number, at least one nonalphanumeric character
- For the admin user you create in order to replace the root user for day-to-day administration tasks: AdministratorAccess
- AmazonS3FullAccess and AmazonEC2FullAccess—which open up only S3 and EC2
- Programatic acccess: Their username and password Their username and password[^1]
    - for a new IAM user you’re creating who will use “programmatic access” to AWS resources: An access key ID and secret access key
    - users don’t sign in through the AWS Management Console; they access through APIs or the AWS CLI.
    - They would therefore not need passwords or MFA.
- IAM users with AWS Management Console access: 
- IAM groups:
    - A set of IAM users 
    - the most efficient method for managing permissions for multiple IAM users, Assign users requiring similar permissions
    - you need to set or update permissions only once for multiple users
- IAM Role: 
    - Permissions granted a trusted entity over specified AWS resources
    - is meant to be assigned to a trusted entity (like another AWS service or a federated identity)
- IAM credential report:
    - provide The current state of security of your IAM users’ access credentials
    - The credential report focuses only on your users’ passwords, access keys, and MFA status
    - is saved to the comma-separated values (spreadsheet) CVS format

### multi-factor authentication
- Users authenticate using a password and also either a physical or virtual MFA device
- requires at least two (“multi”) authentication methods
- include a password (something you know) and a token sent to either a virtual or physical MFA device (something you have)
- secure your AWS root user: Enable MFA, Create a strong password[^2]

### SSH
- connect to an EC2: ssh -i mykey.pem ec2-user@54.7.35.103[^3]

### Federated identities
- are for permitting authenticated entities access to AWS resources and data
- They’re not for importing anything from external accounts—neither data nor guidance
- You can provide users authenticated through a third-party identity provider access to backend resources used by your mobile app
- You can provide admins authenticated through AWS Microsoft AD with access to a Microsoft SharePoint farm running on AWS
- third-party federated identity valid standards: SAML 2.0, Active Directory

### Encryption
- client-side master key: encrypts your data while in transit between your office and Amazon S3
- A client-side master key is used to encrypt objects before they reach AWS (specifically S3)
- In-transit encryption requires that the data be encrypted on the remote client before uploading
- Server-side encryption (either SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) only encrypts data within S3 buckets
- KMS: 
    - cannot be encrypted using KMS: Existing AWS Elastic Block Store volumes, You can only encrypt an EBS volume at creation, not later
    - KMS use Customer master key to encrypt objects stored on your AWS account

### Security Standards
- PCI DSS: standards governs AWS-based applications processing credit card transactions
- SOC:
    - Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports found on AWS Artifact
    - They attest to AWS infrastructure compliance with data accountability standards like Sarbanes–Oxley
    - are reports of audits on AWS infrastructure that you can use as part of your own reporting requirements
- AWS Artifact documents
    - They can help you confirm that your deployment infrastructure is compliant with regulatory standards
    - They can provide insight into various regulatory and industry standards that represent best practices
    - AWS Artifact documents are about AWS infrastructure compliance with external standards.
    - They do not represent internal AWS design or policies

[^1]: When the correct login page (such as https://291976716973.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) is loaded, an IAM user only needs to enter a username and a valid password. Account numbers and secret access keys are not used for this kind of authentication.
[^2]: The root user should not be used for day-to-day admin tasks—even as part of an “admin” group. The goal is to protect root as much as possible.
[^3]: The -i argument should point to the name (and location) of the key stored on the local (client) machine.
