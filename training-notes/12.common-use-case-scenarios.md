[^1]: The five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework are reliability, performance efficiency, security, cost optimization, and operational excellence. Resiliency is not one of them.
[^2]: Security is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Granting each AWS user their own IAM username and password makes it possible to ensure the confidentiality of data. Enabling S3 versioning protects the integrity of data by maintaining a backup of an object. Deleting an empty S3 bucket doesn’t help with any of these. It’s not possible to create a security group rule that denies access to unused ports since security groups deny any traffic that’s not explicitly allowed.
[^3]: Preventing the accidental termination of an EC2 instance in the Auto Scaling group can avoid overburdening and causing performance issues on the remaining instance, especially during busy times. Using CloudFront can help improve performance for end users by caching the content in an edge location close to them. Doubling the number of instances might improve performance, but because performance is already acceptable, doing this would be inefficient. Monitoring for unauthorized access alone won’t improve performance or performance efficiency.
[^4]: Deleting unused S3 objects and unused application load balancers can reduce costs since you’re charged for both. Deleting unused VPCs and empty S3 buckets won’t reduce costs since they don’t cost anything.
[^5]: Operational excellence is concerned with strengthening the other four pillars of reliability, performance efficiency, security, and cost optimization; automation is the key to achieving each of these. Improving bad processes and making people work longer hours run counter to achieving operational excellence. Adding more security personnel may be a good idea, but it isn’t a key component of operational excellence.
[^6]: In a default VPC, AWS creates a subnet for each Availability Zone in the Region. Hence, if there are three subnets in the default VPC, there must be three Availability Zones.
[^7]: Application load balancer listeners use security groups to control inbound access, so you need to apply a security group that has an inbound rule allowing HTTP access. Applying the security group rule to the database instance won’t help, since users don’t connect directly to the database instance. You can’t apply a security group to a subnet, only a network access control list.
[^8]: An application load balancer can use health checks to identify failed instances and remove them from load balancing. This can prevent a user from ever reaching a failed instance. A load balancer can’t replace a failed instance, but Auto Scaling can. An application load balancer distributes traffic to instances using a round-robin algorithm, not based on how busy those instances are. An application load balancer doesn’t cache content.
[^9]: A launch template tells Auto Scaling how to configure the instances it provisions. A dynamic scaling policy controls how Auto Scaling scales in and out based on CloudWatch metrics. There’s no such thing as a launch directive. Auto Scaling does not reference a CloudFormation template, but you can use a CloudFormation template to create a stack that contains a launch template.
[^10]: The maximum group size limits the number of instances in the group. Setting the group size (also known as the desired capacity) or minimum group size to 5 would increase the number of instances to 5 but would not stop Auto Scaling from subsequently adding more instances. Deleting the target tracking policy would not necessarily prevent the number of instances in the group from growing, as another process such as a scheduled scaling policy could add more instances to the group.
[^11]: A static website serves content just as it’s stored without changing the content on the fly. A WordPress blog, a social media website, and a web-based email application all compile content from a database and mix it in with static content before serving it up to the user.
[^12]: Objects you upload to an S3 bucket are not public by default, nor are they accessible to all AWS users. Even if you try to make an object public using an ACL, S3 will immediately remove the ACL, but you can disable this behavior. S3 never removes objects by default.
[^13]: To have S3 host your static website, you need to enable bucket hosting in the S3 service console. It’s not necessary to disable or enable default encryption or object versioning. There’s also no need to make all objects in the bucket public, but only those that you want S3 to serve up.
[^14]: Purchasing and using a custom domain name is the best option for a friendly URL. You need to name the bucket the same as the domain name. Creating a bucket name with only words is unlikely to work, regardless of Region, as bucket names must be globally unique. A bucket name can’t start with a number.
[^15]: Websites hosted in S3 are served using unencrypted HTTP, not secure HTTPS. The content is publicly readable, but that doesn’t mean the public can modify it. You don’t have to use a custom domain name, as S3 provides an endpoint URL for you. A website hosted in S3 is stored in a bucket, and a bucket exists in only one Region.
[^16]: The reliability of an application can be impacted by the failure of resources the application depends on. One way a resource can fail is if it’s misconfigured. Taking EBS snapshots of an instance or provisioning more instances than you need won’t impact reliability. The user interface being difficult to use might be an annoyance for the user but doesn’t affect the actual reliability of the application.
[^17]: You may have control over your VPC, but the rest of the network between your application and users on the internet is not under your control. Compute, storage, and any database your application uses are, or at least theoretically could be, under your control.
[^18]: An Auto Scaling group can use an ELB health check to determine whether an instance is healthy. There is no such thing as an S3 health check, a VPC health check, or an SNS health check.
[^19]: You’re responsible for S3 charges related to your static website. You’re not charged for compute with S3. No one may modify the content of your site unless you give them permission. The S3 Standard storage class keeps objects in multiple Availability Zones, so the outage of one won’t affect the site.
[^20]: The format of the URL is the bucket name, followed by s3-website-, the Region identifier, and then amazonaws.com.
