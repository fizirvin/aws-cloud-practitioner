### Well-Architected Framework
- The five pillars of the Well-Architected Framework are:
    - reliability, 
    - performance efficiency, 
    - security, 
    - cost optimization, 
    - and operational excellence
- Resiliency is not one of them.
- Security is about protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data 
- Granting each AWS user their own IAM username and password makes it possible to ensure the confidentiality of data
- Enabling S3 versioning protects the integrity of data by maintaining a backup of an object
- maintain or improve performance efficiency on two EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group: 
    - Implementing policies to prevent the accidental termination of EC2 instances in the same Auto Scaling group
    - Using CloudFront
- achieve cost optimization:
    - Deleting unused S3 objects and unused application load balancers can reduce costs since you’re charged for both
- key component of operational excellence: Automating manual processes

### default VPC
In a default VPC, AWS creates a subnet for each Availability Zone in the Region. Hence, if there are three subnets in the default VPC, there must be three Availability Zones.

### The application load balancer listener
- You add an inbound security group rule to allow HTTP traffic on TCP port 80. you apply this security group to allow users to access the application
- Application load balancer listeners use security groups to control inbound access, so you need to apply a security group that has an inbound rule allowing HTTP access. Applying the security group rule to the database instance won’t help, since users don’t connect directly to the database instance. You can’t apply a security group to a subnet, only a network access control list.
- An application load balancer can use health checks to identify failed instances and remove them from load balancing
- This can prevent a user from ever reaching a failed instance
- An application load balancer distributes traffic to instances, enable reliability By routing traffic away from failed instances

### Auto Scaling group
- A launch template tells Auto Scaling how to configure the instances it provisions, contains the configuration information for instance 
- A dynamic scaling policy controls how Auto Scaling scales in and out based on CloudWatch metrics
- The maximum group size limits the number of instances in the group

### S3
- static website hosted on S3: A static website serves content just as it’s stored without changing the content on the fly
- A WordPress blog, a social media website, and a web-based email application all compile content from a database and mix it in with static content before serving it up to the user.
- security of data you store in an S3 bucket:
    - Objects you upload to an S3 bucket are not public by default
    - By default, S3 removes ACLs that allow public read access to objects.
- To have S3 host your static website, you need to enable bucket hosting in the S3 service console, 
- It’s not necessary to disable or enable default encryption or object versioning 
- There’s also no need to make all objects in the bucket public, but only those that you want S3 to serve up
- Purchasing and using a custom domain name is the best option for a friendly URL, 
- Websites hosted in S3 are served using unencrypted HTTP, not secure HTTPS. The content is publicly readable
- You don’t have to use a custom domain name, as S3 provides an endpoint URL for you 
- A website hosted in S3 is stored in a bucket
- The content served is not encrypted in transit
- You’re responsible for S3 charges related to your static website. You’re not charged for compute with S3
- The S3 Standard storage class keeps objects in multiple Availability Zones, so the outage of one won’t affect the site
- The format of the URL is the bucket name, followed by s3-website-, the Region identifier, and then amazonaws.com: http://mygreatwebsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com 

### the reliability of a web application running on EC2 instances
 - The reliability of an application can be impacted by the failure of resources the application depends on
 - Not replacing a misconfigured resource that the application depends on
 - One way a resource can fail is if it’s misconfigured
- You may have control over your VPC, but the rest of the network between your application and users on the internet is not under your control
- Compute, storage, and any database your application uses are under your control
- An Auto Scaling group can use an EC2 system health check to determine whether an instance is healthy
- An Auto Scaling group can ALSO use an ELB health check to determine whether an instance is healthy
