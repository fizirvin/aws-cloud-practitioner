### AWS Regions
- AWS GovCloud: is restricted to authorized customers only
- AWS region designation: us-west-2
- EC2 instances will automatically launch into the Region you currently have selected
- resources are tied to a single Region: resources are run on a physical device, which must live somewhere, It’s a simple matter of finding a single physical host device to run on.
- Benefits: 
    - It can make applications available to end users with lower latency
    - It can make applications more compliant with local regulations
-  The data centers within a “broad geographic area”
- endpoint syntax: ˂service-designation˃.˂region-designation˃.amazonaws.com    
- valid endpoint: Relational Database Service instance in the Northern Virginia Region rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

### Which of the following would be a valid endpoint your developers could use to access a particular Relational Database Service instance you’re running in the Northern Virginia Region?
- rds.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

### Availability Zones
- description: One or more independently powered data centers running a wide range of hardware host types
- to improve the resilience of a EC2 web server: Launch parallel, load-balanced instances in multiple Availability Zones within a single AWS Region
- For most uses, distributing your application infrastructure between multiple AZs within a single Region gives them sufficient fault tolerance
- AZs aren’t restricted to a single data center
- The letter (a, b...) at the end of a designation indicates an Availability Zone, They (appear) to be displayed in random order
- AWS displays AZs in (apparently) random order to prevent too many resources from being launched in too few zones

### Edge locations
- “Data centers running uniform host types”
- not likely to benefit from Amazon edge locations: RDS, Elastic Block Store (EBS)

### Subnet
- The block of IP addresses assigned for use within a single Availability Zone[^1]
- IP address blocks are not assigned at the Region level
- You can manually select the subnet that’s associated with a particular Availability Zone for your new EC2 instance, there’s no default choice

### auto scaling
- ensure that a predefined service level is maintained regardless of external demand or instance failures[^2]
- Auto scaling is an important working element of application high availability

### reliability of a cloud application
- Resource redundancy

### Globally AWS services
- Route 53 and CloudFront are truly global services in that they’re not located in or restricted to any single AWS Region
- not globally: EC2, RDS, resources that can exist in only one Region

### CloudFront distributions
- benefits: Reduced latency access to your content no matter where your end users live

### Amazon Route 53
- Managing domain name registration and traffic routing

### AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- responsibilities of AWS:
    - The security of the cloud
    - Patching underlying virtualization software running in AWS data centers
- Customer's responsabilities:
    - What’s in the cloud, it includes the administration of EC2-based operating systems
- AWS managed service
    - Whatever the customer can control (application code and/or configuration settings) is the customer’s responsibility
    - some managed services are pretty much entirely within Amazon’s sphere, and others leave lots of responsibility with the customer
    - if you can edit it, you own it

### Service Health Dashboard
- is one of the first places you should look when troubleshooting a failing application

### AWS Acceptable Use Policy
- information on the limits AWS imposes on the ways you can use your account resources
- AWS Acceptable Use Policy Web page: https://aws.amazon.com/aup/

[^1]: Imposing virtual networking limits on an instance would be the job of a security group or access control list.
[^2]: Auto scaling doesn’t focus on any one resource (physical or virtual) because it’s interested only in the appropriate availability and quality of the overall service. The job of orchestration is for load balancers, not autoscalers.
