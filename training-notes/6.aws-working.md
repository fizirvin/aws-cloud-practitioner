### AWS Management Console
- use to log into: Identity and Access Management (IAM) username
- You can sign in as the root user or as an IAM user
- you need to specify the account alias or account ID
- session with the AWS Management Console remain active 12 hours
- while logged in as the root, you have view access to all resources in your account, you should select the region in the navigation bar

### resource tag
- Each resource tag you create must have a key, but a value is optional
- Tags don’t have to be unique within an account, and they are case-sensitive.

### AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
- The AWS CLI is a program that runs on Linux, macOS, or Windows and allows you to interact with AWS services from a terminal.
- The AWS CLI requires an access key ID and secret key, You can use those of an IAM user or the root user
- Outbound network access to TCP port 443
- also can use the AWS Console Mobile Application with Android or iOS devices
- AWS CLI on Windows 10: The MSI installer - Using Python and pip
- The aws configure command walks you through setting up the AWS CLI to specify the default Region you want to use as well as your access key ID and secret key
- After installing the AWS Command Line Interface you should Issue the aws configure command
- The aws --version command displays the version of the AWS CLI installed
- Using your root user to manage your AWS resources is insecure, so there’s no need to generate a new access key ID for your root user
- output format: JavaScript object notation (JSON), or table formats

### AWS software development (SDKs)
- The AWS SDKs allow you to use popular programming languages to write applications that interact with AWS services.
- programming languages availables: JavaScript, Java, PHP
- mobile applications: AWS Mobile SDK for Unity, AWS Mobile SDK for .NET and Xamarin
- AWS Internet of Things (IoT) device software development kits: Javascript, C++, Python, Java, and Embedded C

### CloudWatch
- Metrics: store performance data from AWS services
- Logs store text-based logs from applications and AWS services
- Events are actions that occur against your AWS resources
- Events monitors events that cause changes in your AWS resources as well as AWS Management Console sign-in events
- In response to an event, CloudWatch Events can take an action including sending an SNS notification or rebooting an EC2 instance
- It can send an SNS notification when an IAM user logs in to the AWS Management Console.
- It can shut down an EC2 instance at a specific time.
- CloudWatch Events can also perform actions on a schedule. It doesn’t monitor logs or metrics
- Alarms: A CloudWatch alarm monitors a metric and triggers when that metric exceeds a specified threshold
    -  Termination of an EC2 instance is an event, and you can’t create a CloudWatch alarm to trigger based on an event
    -  You also can’t create an alarm to trigger based on the presence of an IP address in a web server log
    -  you could create a metric filter to look for a specific IP address in the log and increment a custom metric when that IP address appears in the log
- a CloudWatch alarm to send a notification: A metric that exceeds a given threshold
- Metric filters extract metric information from logs

### Simple Notification Service (SNS) 
- protocols to send a notification: : Short Message Service (SMS) text message, Simple Queue Service (SQS)

### API actions
- Viewing an AWS resource triggers an API action: Viewing an S3 bucket from the AWS Management Console
- Listing IAM users from the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)

### CloudTrail
- CloudTrail event history: the most cost-effective way to view and search only the last 60 days of management API events, stores the last 90 days of management events for each Region
- Creating a trail: would involve storing logs in an S3 bucket. 
- Streaming CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch would require creating a trail.
- to log every object downloaded from an S3 bucket: the most cost-effective: Stream CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs, Create a trail to log S3 data events
- Creating a trail in the Region where the bucket exists will generate CloudTrail logs, which you can then stream to CloudWatch for viewing and searching. 
- CloudTrail event history doesn’t log data events. 
- CloudTrail logs global service events by default, but S3 data events are not included.
- using CloudTrail log file integrity validation: It lets you assert that no CloudTrail log files have been deleted from S3[^1]

[^1]: Log file integrity validation uses cryptographic hashing to help you assert that no CloudTrail log files have been deleted from S3. It doesn’t prevent tampering or deletion and can’t tell you how a file has been tampered with. Log file integrity validation has nothing to do with CloudWatch.
