[^1]: You can sign in as the root user or as an IAM user. Although you need to specify the account alias or account ID to log in as an IAM user, those are not credentials. You can’t log in to the console using an access key ID.
[^2]: Once you’re logged in, your session will remain active for 12 hours. After that, it’ll expire and log you out to protect your account.
[^3]: If a resource that should be visible appears to be missing, you may have the wrong Region selected. Since you’re logged in as the root, you have view access to all resources in your account. You don’t need an access key to use the console. You can’t select an Availability Zone in the navigation bar.
[^4]: Each resource tag you create must have a key, but a value is optional. Tags don’t have to be unique within an account, and they are case-sensitive.
[^5]: The AWS CLI requires an access key ID and secret key. You can use those of an IAM user or the root user. Outbound network access to TCP port 443 is required, not port 80. Linux is also not required, although you can use the AWS CLI with Linux, macOS, or Windows. You also can use the AWS Console Mobile Application with Android or iOS devices.
[^6]: You can use Python and the pip package manager or (with the exception of Windows Server 2008) the MSI installer to install the AWS CLI on Windows. AWS SDKs don’t include the AWS CLI. Yum and Aptitude are package managers for Linux only.
[^7]: The aws configure command walks you through setting up the AWS CLI to specify the default Region you want to use as well as your access key ID and secret key. The aws --version command displays the version of the AWS CLI installed, but running this command isn’t necessary to use the AWS CLI to manage your resources. Rebooting is also not necessary. Using your root user to manage your AWS resources is insecure, so there’s no need to generate a new access key ID for your root user.
[^8]: The AWS CLI can display output in JSON, text, or table formats. It doesn’t support CSV or TSV.
[^9]: AWS offers SDKs for JavaScript, Java, and PHP. There are no SDKs for Fortran. JSON is a format for representing data, not a programming language.
