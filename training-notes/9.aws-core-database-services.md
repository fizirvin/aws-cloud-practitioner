### Relational database
- A relational database stores data in columns called attributes and rows called records 
- Structured Query Language (SQL) statements: to write data to a relational database table
- The SQL INSERT statement can be used to add data to a relational database
- The QUERY command is used to read data. CREATE can be used to create a table but not add data to it
- RDS instances use Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumess for storage
- Instance volumes are for temporary, not database storage
- You can take a snapshot of a database instance and restore it to a new instance with a new EBS volume
- PostgreSQL and Amazon Aurora are options for RDS database engines
- Aurora is Amazon’s proprietary database engine that works with existing PostgreSQL and MySQL databases
- Relational Database Service (RDS) can prevent data loss in the event of an Availability Zone failure:  Multi-AZ and snapshots can protect your data
- Amazon Aurora is an RDS database engine offers automatically expanding database storage up to 64 TB
- Multi-AZ  can help you achieve a monthly availability of 99.95 percent
- Multi-AZ lets your database withstand the failure of an RDS instance, even if the failure is due to an entire Availability Zone failing
- Data warehouse: A data warehouse stores large amounts of structured data from other relational databases for reporting and analysis

### Nonrelational databases
- Nonrelational databases—including key-value stores and document stores—store data in collections or items but don’t use columns or rows
- A nonrelational database is schemaless
- You don’t have to define all the types of data that a table can store before adding data to it
- A primary key is required to uniquely identify each item in a table
- A no-SQL database is another term for a nonrelational database. By definition, nonrelational databases are schemaless and must use primary keys
- nonrelational databases DynamoDB
- DynamoDB partition:
    - It’s backed by solid-state drives
    - It’s replicated across multiple Availability Zones
    - A partition is an allocation of storage backed by solid-state drives and replicated across multiple Availability Zones. Tables are stored across partitions
- The minimum monthly availability for DynamoDB is 99.99 percent in a single Region
- Items in a DynamoDB table can have different attributes. For example, one item can have five attributes, while another has only one. A table can store items containing multiple data types 
- There’s no need to predefine the number of items in a table. Items in a table can’t have duplicate primary keys.
- configuration parameters to improve write performance against a DynamoDB table:
    -  Increasing WCU or enabling Auto Scaling will improve write performance against a table
    - Enable DynamoDB Auto Scaling
- A primary key must be unique within a table. A full name, phone number, or city may not be unique. A randomly generated ID would be unique for use as a primary key

### Redshift
- Dense compute nodes use magnetic storage disks
- Redshift Spectrum can analyze structured data stored in S3
- Dense storage nodes can be used in a cluster to store up to 2 PB of data
- Dense compute nodes can be used to store up to 326 TB of data
