### EC2 AMI?
- To serve as a source image from which an instance’s primary storage volume is built
- AWS Marketplace: verified AMIs from both AWS and third-party vendors
- The Quick Start: includes only the few dozen most popular AMIs. 
- The Community tab: includes thousands of publicly available AMIs—whether verified or not 
- The My AMIs tab: only includes AMIs created from your account
- ould be included in an EC2 AMI: A software application stack, An operating system
- AMIs can be created that provide both a base operating system and a pre-installed application. 
- They would not, however, include any networking or hardware profile information—those are largely determined by the instance type.

### EC2 instance 
- type families: Compute optimized, Accelerated computing
- virtual central processing unit (vCPU) is a metric that roughly measures an instance type’s compute power in terms of the number of processors on a physical server.
- dedicated instance: An EC2 instance running on a physical host reserved for the exclusive use of a single AWS account

### EC2 instance storage
- EBS volume: A virtualized partition of a physical storage drive that’s not directly connected to the EC2 instance it’s associated with
- instance store volume: A virtualized partition of a physical storage drive that is directly connected to the EC2 instance
    - Instance store volumes provide faster data read/write performance.
    - Instance store volumes are connected directly to your EC2 instance.
    - Instance store volumes cannot be encrypted, nor will their data survive an instance shutdown. Those are features of EBS volumes.

### pricing models
- On-demand: for those extra instances, Your web application experiences periodic spikes in demand that require the provisioning of extra instances
- Spot instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since they can be shut down unexpectedly. 
- Reserved instances make economic sense where they’ll be used 24/7 over long stretches of time. 
- Reserved for the “base” instances that will run constantly, Your web application experiences periodic spikes in demand that require the provisioning of extra instances
- Reserved instances will work here because your “base” instances will need to run 24/7 over the long term. 
- Spot and spot fleet instances are unreliable for this sort of usage since they can be shut down unexpectedly. 
- On-demand instances will incur unnecessarily high costs over such a long period.
- reserved instance: Charges for any instances you run matching the reserved instance type will be covered by the reservation.
- You choose how you’ll pay for a reserved instance. All Upfront, Partial Upfront, and No Upfront are available options, and there is no automatic billing. An instance would never be launched automatically in this context.
- for spot instances: Big data processing workloads, Continuous integration development environments
- Because spot instances can be shut down, they’re not recommended for applications that provide any kind of always-on service.
 
## Elastic Beanstalk && Lightsail
- simplify the process of bringing web applications to deployment
- use primarily EC2 resources under the hood

### Lightsail
- bills at a flat rate regardless of how it’s consumed[^1] 
- Lightsail blueprints: Gitlab, LAMP

### Elastic Container Service && Elastic Beanstalk
- services are designed to let you deploy Docker containers[^2]

### AWS Lambda
- Python is, indeed, a valid choice for a function’s runtime environment. There is no one “primary” language for Lambda API calls
- timing out: 15 minutes, is the maximum time a Lambda function

[^1]: Beanstalk, EC2, and RDS all bill according to actual usage.
[^2]: While you could, in theory at least, manually install Docker Engine on either a Lightsail or EC2 instance, that’s not their primary function. Container technologies: Docker, Kubernetes
