### AWS cloud provider value[^1]
- multiregional presence
- metered, pay-per-use pricing
- highly experienced teams of security engineers

### highly available application
- a failure in one geographic region will trigger an automatic failover to resources in a different region
- spikes in user demand are met through automatically increasing resources

### metered payment model benefits
- experiments with multiple configuration options are now cost-effective
- full-stack applications are possible without the need to invest in capital expenses

### server virtualization benefits
- fast resource provisioning and launching
- efficient (high-density) use of resources

### hypervisor
> software used to administrate virtualized resources run on physical infrastructure

### server virtualization
> logically partitioning physical compute and storage devices into multiple smaller virtual devices

### infrastructure as a service IaaS
> services that give you direct control over underlying compute and storage resources

### platform as a service PaaS
> services that hide infrastructure complexity behind a simple interface

### software as a service SaaS
> services that provide a service to end users through a public network

### scalability
> the ability of an application to automatically add preconfigured compute resources to meet increasing demand

### elasticity[^2]
> the ability of an application to increase or decrease compute resources to match changing demand

### AWS scalable services characteristics
- its highly automated infrastructure administration systems
- the enormous number of servers it operates

[^1]: Having globally distributed infrastructure and experienced security engineers makes a provider’s infrastructure more reliable. Metered pricing makes a wider range of workloads possible.
[^2]: Preconfiguring compute instances before they’re used to scale up an application is an element of scalability rather than elasticity.
