### Cloud Computing benefits
- scalability: the ability of an application to automatically add preconfigured compute resources to meet increasing demand[^1]
- elasticity: the ability of an application to increase or decrease compute resources to match changing demand
- high availability: 
    - a failure in one geographic region will trigger an automatic failover to resources in a different region
    - spikes in user demand are met through automatically increasing resources

### server virtualization benefits
> server virtualization: logically partitioning physical compute and storage devices into multiple smaller virtual devices[^2]
- fast resource provisioning and launching
- efficient (high-density) use of resources

### AWS cloud provider value
- metered, pay-per-use pricing (makes a wider range of workloads possible)
- multiregional presence, globally distributed infrastructure (for reliable)
- highly experienced teams of security engineers (for reliable)
- its highly automated infrastructure administration systems (for scalable services)
- the enormous number of servers it operates (for scalable services)

### metered payment model benefits
- experiments with multiple configuration options are now cost-effective
- full-stack applications are possible without the need to invest in capital expenses

## AWS Cloud Computing Models
- infrastructure as a service IaaS: services that give you direct control over underlying compute and storage resources
- platform as a service PaaS: services that hide infrastructure complexity behind a simple interface
- software as a service SaaS: services that provide a service to end users through a public network
