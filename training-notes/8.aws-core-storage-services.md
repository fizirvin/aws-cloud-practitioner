### Bucket Names
- Bucket names must be globally unique across AWS, irrespective of Region
- The length of the bucket name isn’t an issue since it’s between 3 and 63 characters long

### STANDARD_IA && GLACIER S3 storage classes 
- are most cost-effective for infrequently accessed data that can’t be easily replaced?
- offer the highest levels of redundancy and are replicated across at least three Availability Zones.
- Due to their low level of availability (99.9 and 99.5 percent, respectively), they’re the most cost-effective for infrequently accessed data
- ONEZONE_IA stores objects in only one Availability Zone, so the loss of that zone could result in the loss of all objects. 
- The STANDARD and INTELLIGENT_TIERING classes provide the highest levels of durability and cross-zone replication but are also the least cost-effective for this use case

### Simple Storage Service (S3) and Elastic Block Store (EBS)
-  EBS stores volumes.
-  S3 stores objects.

### S3 object life cycle configurations perform automatically
- Deleting old object versions, Moving objects to Glacier, Deleting old objects
- Object life cycle configurations can perform transition or expiration actions based on an object’s age.
- Transition actions can move objects between storage classes, such as between STANDARD and GLACIER. 
- Expiration actions can delete objects and object versions. 
- Object life cycle configurations can’t delete buckets or move objects to an EBS volume.

### access to an object in S3?
- You can use bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) to grant anonymous users access to an object in S3
- You can’t use user policies to do this, although you can use them to grant IAM principals access to objects

### storage option use case 
-  5 TB database file it needs to retain off-site for at least 5 years. it must be accessible within 8 hours
- S3 Glacier, Glacier is the most cost effective
- Both S3 and Glacier are designed for durable, long-term storage and offer the same level of durability
- Data stored in Glacier can be reliably retrieved within eight hours using the Expedited or Standard retrieval options 
- Data stored in S3 can be retrieved even faster than Glacier. S3 can store objects up to 5 TB in size, and Glacier can store archives up to 40 TB 
- Both S3 or Glacier will meet the given requirements, but Glacier is the more cost-effective solution

### S3 Glacier
- You can create or delete vaults from the Glacier service console
- You can’t upload, download, or delete archives. To perform archive actions, you must use the AWS Command Line Interface, an AWS SDK, or a third-party programS
- Standard - Glacier retrieval option generally takes 3 to 5 hours to complete
- The Standard retrieval option typically takes 3 to 5 hours to complete. Expedited takes 1 to 5 minutes, and Bulk takes 5 to 12 hours
- minimum size for a Glacier archive: 1 byte
-  A Glacier archive can be as small as 1 byte and as large as 40 TB. You can’t have a zero-byte archive

### AWS Storage Gateway
- iSCSI protocol: let you connect your servers to block storage for Tape gateway && Volume gateway
- The tape gateway and volume gateway types let you connect to iSCSI storage 
- The file gateway supports NFS
- All AWS Storage Gateway types—file, volume, and tape gateways—primarily store data in S3 buckets
- From there, data can be stored in Glacier or EBS snapshots, which can be instantiated as EBS volumes
- The AWS Storage Gateway allows transferring files from on-premises servers to S3 using industry-standard storage protocols
- The AWS Storage Gateway functioning as a file gateway supports the SMB and NFS protocols. As a volume Ggateway, it supports the iSCSI protocol
- The volume gateway type offers two configurations: stored volumes and cached volumes
- Stored volumes asynchronously back up data to S3 as EBS snapshots. Can be up to 16 TB in size
- Cached volumes locally store only a frequently used subset of data. Can be up to 32 TB in size

### Snowball device
- The 80 TB Snowball device offers 72 TB of usable storage and is the largest available. The 50 TB Snowball offers 42 TB of usable space.
- security features of AWS Snowball
    - AWS Snowball enforces encryption at rest and in transit.
    - It uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip to detect unauthorized changes to the hardware or software
- If AWS detects any signs of tampering or damage, it will not replace the TPM chip or transfer customer data from the device
- Instead, AWS will Securely erase the customer’s data from the device
- The Snowball Client lets you transfer files to or from a Snowball using a machine running Windows, Linux, or macOS
- Snowball Edge offers compute power to run EC2 instances and supports copying files using the NFSv3 and NFSv4 protocols
- The Snowball Edge—Compute Optimized with GPU option is optimized for machine learning and high-performance computing applications
- Snowball Edge with the Compute Optimized configuration includes a QSFP+ network interface that supports up to 100 Gbps 
- The Storage Optimized configuration has a QSFP+ port that supports only up to 40 Gbps
-  The 80 TB Snowball supports only up to 10 Gbps
