### CloudFormation
- CloudFormation can create AWS resources and manages them collectively in a stack 
- Templates are written in the CloudFormation language, not Python
- It lets you create multiple separate AWS environments using a single template
- CloudFormation templates are written in the YAML or JSON format.
- Parameters let you input customizations when creating a CloudFormation stack without changing the template
- Resources CloudFormation creates are organized into stacks and can be managed as a single unit
- When you update a stack, CloudFormation analyzes the relationships among resources in the stack and updates dependent resources as necessary
- CloudFormation stack updates help ensure that changes to one resource won’t break another

### CodeCommit
- CodeCommit is a private Git repository that offers versioning and differencing
- Differencing lets you see the differences between two versions of a file, which can be useful when figuring out what change introduced a bug
- Versioning is what allows reverting to an older version of a file

### CI/CD
- Continuous integration is the practice of running code through a build or test process as soon as it’s checked into a repository 
- Continuous delivery and continuous deployment include continuous integration but add deployment to the process

### CodeBuild
- Environments: Build.general1.medium and build.general1.large support Windows and Linux operating systems 
- Build.general1.small supports Linux only
- A CodeBuild build environment always contains an operating system and a Docker image

### CodeDeploy
- CodeDeploy can Deploy an application to an on-premises Windows instance.
- Deploy a Docker container to the Elastic Container Service.
- Upgrade an application on an EC2 instance running Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### CodePipeline
- At the very least, a CodePipeline must consist of a source stage and a deploy stage (2 actions)

### AutoScaling
- A launch template can be used to launch instances manually and with EC2 Auto Scaling
- The maximum and minimum group size values limit the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group
- The desired capacity (also known as the group size) is the number of instances that Auto Scaling will generally maintain
- Auto Scaling can launch or terminate instances if dynamic scaling calls for it
- Auto Scaling will use self-healing to replace the failed instance to maintain the desired capacity of 7
- Auto Scaling won’t ever change the desired capacity in response to a failed instance
- Predictive scaling creates a scheduled scaling action based on past usage patterns

### type of AWS Systems Manager document
- An Automation document can perform administrative tasks on AWS, such as starting or stopping an instance, can take a snapshot of an EC2 instance
- A Command document can execute commands on an EC2 instance

### OpsWorks services
- AWS OpsWorks Stacks uses Chef recipes, while 
- AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise uses Puppet modules
- OpsWorks supports the Puppet Enterprise and Chef configuration management platforms
- Only an OpsWorks Stack layer contains at least one EC2 instance
