### VPC
- AWS creates a default VPC in each Region
- By default, each default VPC is available to one AWS account
- A VPC spans all Availability Zones within a Region
- A VPC peering connection is a private connection between only two VPCs
- It uses the private AWS network, and not the public internet
- A VPC peering connection is different than a VPN connection

### CIDR for a VPC or subnet
- A VPC or subnet CIDR can have a size between /16 and /28 inclusive, so 10.0.0.0/28 would be the only valid CIDR

### subnets
- A subnet must have a CIDR that’s a subset of the CIDR of the VPC in which it resides
- A subnet spans one Availability Zone
- a VPC must have at least one subnet

### Security group
- A security group is a firewall that operates at the instance level
- It contains an outbound rule allowing access to any IP address
- It doesn’t contain an inbound rule by default
- Security group rules can only permit access, not deny it, so any traffic not explicitly allowed will be denied

### Network access control list (NACL)
- A network access control list is a firewall that operates at the subnet level.

### Virtual private network (VPN) connection
- A VPN connection uses the internet for transport, encrypting data with AES 128- or 256-bit encryption

### Direct Connect connection
- A Direct Connect connection offers predictable latency because it doesn’t traverse the internet
- A Direct Connect link uses a dedicated link rather than the internet to provide predictable latency
- Direct Connect doesn’t use encryption but provides some security by means of a private link

### Route 53
- You can register a domain name for a term of up to 10 years
- Route 53 creates a public hosted zone for the domain
- The registrar and DNS hosting provider don’t have to be the same entity, but often are
- A Multivalue Answer routing policy can return a set of multiple values, sorted randomly. A simple record returns a single value
- A Failover routing policy always routes users to the primary resource unless it’s down, in which case it routes users to the secondary resource
- A Latency routing policy sends users to the resource in the AWS Region that provides the least latency
- All Route 53 routing policies except for Simple can use health checks
- Endpoint health check (types of Route 53 health checks) works by making a test connection to a TCP port
- An Endpoint health check works by connecting to the monitored endpoint via HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP
- A Weighted routing policy lets you distribute traffic to endpoints according to a ratio that you define. None of the other routing policies allows this
- Weighted use case: You want to distribute 20 percent of traffic to one instance and 80 percent to the other
- A private hosted zone is associated with a VPC and allows resources in the VPC to resolve private domain names, 
- A private hosted zone is able to resolve internal IP addresses for other resources in the VPC, No one outside of the VPC should be able to resolve these addresses
- Route 53 private hosted zones provide DNS resolution for a single domain name within multiple VPCs

### CloudFront edge location
- CloudFront has edge locations on six continents
- A CloudFront origin is the location that a distribution sources content from for caching. Content is stored in edge locations
- A distribution defines the edge locations and origins to use
- The RTMP distribution type is for delivering streaming content and requires you to provide a media player
- A Web distribution can also stream audio or video content but doesn’t require you to provide a media player
- to users in the United States and Canada: United States, Canada, and Europe will be the most cost effective for your CloudFront distribution
- There are more than 150 edge locations throughout the world
- An origin can be an EC2 instance or a public S3 bucket
