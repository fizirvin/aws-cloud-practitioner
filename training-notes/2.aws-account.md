[^6]: Tags are passive, so they can’t automatically trigger anything. Resource tags—not cost allocation tags—are meant to help you understand and control deployments.
[^8]: Companies with multiple users of resources in a single AWS account would not benefit from AWS Organizations, nor would a company with completely separated units.
